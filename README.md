## Cryptomerce

**Cryptomerce is a project I'm developing to improve my Solidity skills. It is a smart contract implementation of an e-commerce system.**


### TODOs For Development

- [ ] Maybe you want to set the prices in dollars, ETH may +- fastly (Use Dollars for e-commerce in frontend, but eth in backend (oracle))
    - [ ] OR implement a Stablecoin that is pegged to USD or any other exchange (e.g. DAI, USDC)
- [ ] Implement swap products

### TODOs for Testing
- [X] Test buyProduct
- [ ] Test swap functionalities
